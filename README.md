## Avoid The Light
A navigation based puzzle game where you play as a vampire trying to return to their coffin as daybreaks. As you navigate your cathedral you must avoid the light that pours into the windows by ducking under objects, jumping over pits, and finding keys to open locked doors that impede your progress. Includes one level that teaches the player the controls and has them navigate one floor of the cathedral.

This project was created for Game Content Production II class at the University of Florida and presented at Convergence 2025. It is written in C# using Unity 6.
